                            <p> I am thinking of buying an Android device that does not have NFC. All the info on CBA's website regarding the PayTag sticker refers only to the iPhone. There are media articles about PayTag for Android, but nothing recent. Does anyone here have a CBA PayTag sticker with an Android device and can confirm it works? Alternatively, does anyone know of a bank that has such a product for Android? I thought this would be the best sub to ask, sorry if I'm in the wrong place. Thank. I recently baught a Xiaomi Pocophone and I knew from the start that it didn't come with NFC. However, recently I'm in need of using it. I'm really happy with my phone. I just need to know if there is any sort of adapter or gadget that can give my phone this ability Thx guys Sry for the English. non natural English speaker. 
Looking at picking up a watch, my phone does not have NFC. Would this prevent me from using a watch with NFC with Android. I know you are able to use android wear with an iphone with limited functionality, but does anybody know if its possible to use the Android Pay functionality on a Huawei Watch 2 that's linked with an iPhone? On the fence about my next phone and I've just bought my new watch and I use the NFC feature what is the minimum device that supports nfc and android pay and is both the oldest device and oldest device still on the carrier stores. Hi all, I am working on a project for my course and would just like some input whether or not you think it is possible. I have my raspberry pi that is utilising the pn532 NFC board. I want to be able to make contact to the android device and scan it for vulnerabilities would this be possible. When paying for things at the shops the NFC thing has been playing up. Holding it to the terminal the phone just either does nothing or vibrates then does nothing. It used to work brilliantly before but just started playing a couple of weeks ago. Anyone have this problem With FareBot (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codebutler.farebot) you just need to tap your phone to your card and it'll give you your balance, a list of recent refills, recent trips, and even a map of your trips. It's a really simple app but a great way to quickly check the balance of your Clipper Card. edit: To be clear, this app doesn't link to your account, it just uses your phone's NFC to read the info that's stored Previously my phone would be able to send/receive things via Android Beam with another phone but recently it's stopped working when the bluetooth is switched off. NFC seems to be unable to activate bluetooth temporarily to receive/send files. The other phone would always turn its bluetooth on but not the Moto X Style. It's a hassle remembering to turn the bluetooth on to use NFC, does anyone 
I need a cheap android phone with NFC capabilities. I want to play around with it but can't find anything. Does anyone know of a good and cheap NFC capable android phone. So I am really interested in getting an android watch but don't have a lot to spend. What is the lowest price point I can get and still have support for android. Hello! A friend of mine tried to beam me some YouTube videos but we just couldn't do the beam. I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus with android 4.4.3, my friend has the HTC One X with android 4.2.1 We tried to activate the beam manually but the HTC doesn't have the check mark for the android beam, only the NFC activation and I guessed that would be it but it doesn't work. I searched over the net for a solution but the very few they have doesn't work. I know my NFC works for I have beamed before. 
then I browsed through some of the NFC threads here, but none of them really mention using Android Beam and NFC between devices. It seems like my best bet will be to import a handset from USA - but then I am not that confident in my ability to judge how compatible it will be. The Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G coming out in 6 days might fit the bill perfectly. Any advice gratefully received. After their initial statement to Ausdroid on Friday (Australia time) Huawei Australia have come back to us today very apologetic and retracted the statement saying that the Huawei Watch one had NFC and was getting Android Pay. We've updated the original post ( so any traffic will get the correct information. Rather than attempt to message or reply to everyone who has messaged me I`m putting </p>
