Best Free Alternative to Fdisk for Windows 10/8/7 About Fdisk. Fdisk is a command line utility included with MS DOS that allows you to format. Fully support Windows 10/8/8.1/7 Can we find free partition. Free Windows Fdisk equivalent - AOMEI Partition Assistant. I had my Windows 10 installed on a 1 TB SSD and I decided this morning, "Hey why don't I install a 500 GB Linux partition on my 1TB HDD I'm not even using". So I make a USB Installer through Rufus with Manjaro Linux and went in my BIOS and booted to my HDD with the USB Installer, I went about installing it and made a 500 GB partition for Manjaro with a 6 GB for linuxswap. I then played around with it a bit and then decided I wanted to go back to my Windows 10 drive and play some games. I switch. 
In this Windows 10 guide, we'll walk you through the steps to use DiskPart to successfully clean, format, label, and assign a drive letter using the Command Prompt. I’m running a late 2013 iMac with a 1Tb fusion drive and Mojave. My windows 10 boot camp installation has been continually bluescreening with Kernel Security Errors for over a year now (pretty sure it started after a particular Windows Update was installed) and I tried just about everything I read on the internet to resolve. Some steps reduced likelihood of occurrence but in the end it was still happening and I had enough messing around. So like a complete idiot I decided to reinstall How to Scan & Fix Hard Drives with CHKDSK in Windows 10. Even in Windows 10, the CHKDSK command is run via the Command Prompt, but we’ll need to use administrative privileges to properly access it. To launch a Command Prompt as an Administrator, press the keyboard shortcut Windows Key + X to bring up the power users Hello everyone, amp#x200B; So I managed to install Qubes 4.0.1 in my system, but there's no Qubes boot option after install. amp#x200B; I tried following this guide (https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/uefi-troubleshooting/#installation-finished-but-qubes-boot-option-is-missing-and-xencfg-is-empty), but I am having some trouble with the efibootmgr line. 1. efibootmgr -v -c -u -L Qubes -l /EFI/qubes/xen.efi -d /dev/sda -p 1 "placeholder /mapbs /noexitboot" amp#x200B; MiniTool is a perfect FDISK Windows 10 alternative with its powerful features and simple steps. Compared with FDISK format tool, MiniTool Partition Wizard has better compatibility. It supports major 32-bit/64-bit PC operating systems, as well as hard drives with common ports like IDE, ATA, STATA So I have a 16GB USB3 drive, that just decided not to work anymore sometime in the last month. Didn't really notice when, but I just assumed a quick format will solve it. Well, surprise surprise, it did not. And now I am curious what happened to it, and how to solve it. amp#x200B; Symptoms: Plug in the drive (Arch Linux with KDE), device notifier pops up detecting new 14.7GB Removable drive, I select it and click on Open with File Manager, Dolphin opens up, and there is a System Volume. 
Super Fdisk is a FREE driven disk partition manager. With the freeware you can quickly and easily create, delete, format partitions on IDE/ATA/SATA/SCSI hard disk drives without destroying data DOS system. Has anyone set up a dual boot with windows 10 and arch, and can explain the process? I've tried to read the wiki, but it seems to contradict itself at almost every step, and I have no idea how to make this work. It says that I need to make a partition with the type `BIOS boot` in fdisk, but that's not an option, then it says that it needs to be fat32, but there are a few of those, and I can't tell if it means the partition type, or the `mkfs` thing for fat32. Then it says to install How to Access Disk Management in Windows 10 First Way: Power Menu. The easiest way to access the Disk Management in Windows 10 is the Power user Menu. All you need to do is to make right click on the Start Menu icon and in the arrived list of commands, you will see Disk Management. Perform a click FIXED As pointed by /u/unidentifiedperson I was trying to create my partitions on an already nested partition "sdcXpX", so I tried this again on the main partition "sdx" and got it working. Thanks for the advice! ORIGINAL POST First hello everyone and thanks for reading this, I'd like to tell that I'm new to this sub and new to Arch Linux, any help on this matter would be really appreciated! Also I'd like to tell that I'm still looking for this problem on google, but almost every forum. 
Initialize new disks. 10/24/2018; 2 minutes to read; Contributors. In this article. Applies To: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012 If you add a brand new disk to your PC and it doesn't show up in File Explorer, you might need to add a drive letter, or initialize it before using. I'm currently running Arch on a GPT partitioned SSD. It has one ESP (550MiB) and one EXT4 partition taking up the rest of the space (no separate partitions for either the SWAP nor `/home`). I'm using `rEFInd` to boot Arch, and it's located on the ESP. No LVM, no RAID, no bullshit. Right now I want to install Windows 10 alongside my Arch installation, and after doing some research, the steps that I need to take are the following: 1. Boot into any linux live-usb including the basic partitioni. Run CHKDSK trough Command Prompt. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin)) 2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “CHKDSK X:”, we suggest you use “CHKDSK X: /F”, only then it can correct errors. 3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK. Hey all! I’ve been chasing down a gremlin in my CentOS 7 VM running inside Virtual Box on a Windows 10 host. I need to pull some log files off of my Linux vm and cannot, for the life of me, get a USB drive to attach and mount. -USB drive is a 16GB flash drive formatted to FAT32 -Host is running Virtual Box 6.0.4 with the corresponding expansion pack. -USB filter has been created for the specific USB drive You cannot format a disk or partition that is currently in use, including the partition that contains Windows. The Perform a quick format option will create a new file table, but will not fully overwrite or erase the volume. A quick format is much faster than a normal format, which fully erases any existing data on the volume. \ \ \ SOLVED\ \ \ I had another external drive with windows 10 which i used for particular reasons occasionally, and disabling fast boot on windows 10 did the trick! Thanks so much guys! amp#x200B; Hey guys, I'm somewhat of a linux noob, but not fresh off the boat from windows. Anyway, I have 2 ntfs drives in my computer and an ssd that ubuntu is installed on. The problem is (obviously) that I can't write to these drives. I've tried all kinds of stuff like editing the fdisk file in various. I just bought a 2TB hard drive, I don't know how to get my computer to have 2TB's of free space on it to install DOOM 2016. I found the hard drive when I followed THIS (https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/trying-to-manually-mount-second-hard-drive-in-ubuntu-10-10-a-877232/) advice.

Hey Guys, Last couple of weeks I've been distro hopping, going through popular distros suggested here (on reddit) like: Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Manjaro. This was untill I finally settled for MX Linux, which seemed perfect for my needs. Keep in mind I was double booting the whole time. My MX Linux installaton worked perfectly untill I decided to upgrade to a bigger SSD in my machine, which is a ThinkPad x230 (128 to 500gb). amp#x200B; When I installed my new SSD I did the usual (I think) double. Hey all! I’ve been chasing down a gremlin in my CentOS 7 VM running inside Virtual Box on a Windows 10 host.

Hello, amp#x200B; Recently my android phone just crashed on me and upon reboot, it said the SD Card was corrupter. Oh well, I took it out and put it into my Windows 10 computer. Not detected. Alright, tried it into my Arch Linux system, and got some strange results: lsblk detects the card, but no partitions: `sdc 8:32 1 59.5G 0 disk` (yes I do use a microsd to usb adapter, but the result is the same with a microsd to sd adapter as well) amp#x200B; running any disc utility. Whitera1n for OSX, the all in one iPhone/iPod Touch 1.0-1.1.5 solution. Apple doesn't want you doing this, but i do. A note about iTunes v7.5: iTunes v7.5 is the last version apple made that does not require any internet connection to use all of it's functions. You can restore, update, sync, etc all offline, apple has no say. There is no "Verifying update/restore with Apple". iTunes v7.5 supports restoring/updating firmware 1.0-1.1.5. It is required for Whitera1n Tried FAT in Windows 10 and Linux. FDISK still shows a non-DOS partition (2GB). Don't have a CD so I need to copy Win95 to the SSD and install from there. I know I'm missing something FINAL EDIT: Thanks to superuru (https://www.reddit.com/user/superuru) for suggesting to plug the SSDs to the grey INTEL SATA ports, now Linux recognizes both of them. Thanks so much everyone for taking the time and the effort to help me understand the issue and providing explanations. Thank you so much! amp#x200B; amp#x200B; I have a machine with Windows 10 and an SSD. Today I've bought a new SSD to use it just for a Linux distro. When I booted through the CD, it doesn't recognize (VirtualBox 5.2.26, Linux Mint 19.1 host, Windows 10 guest) For the life of me, I cannot disable fast start. Every tutorial points me to the same thing - enabling hidden entries in the Power Management applet in Control Panel. On my system, none of these options show up. I have another Windows 10 install (not a VM) that was simple to do this on. What am I missing? I ran 'powercfg /H off', which seemed to disable hibernation, but fast start remains. I need to be able to access EDIT: Solved, solution in comments. So, I updated, in Cydia, from Substitute to Substrate. I checked the queue, two tasks queued:Install: Substrate Uninstall: Substitute I hit confirm, the process ran, then reloaded SpringBoard amp#x200B; When SpringBoard went to reload, it got stuck reloading for quite some time. Evidently it eventually gave up, and the phone rebooted. Now, whenever I try to jailbreak again it does the same thing (respring to reboot) every single time when the Jailb. </p>
